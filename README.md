# ML project-Telco Customer Churn Prediction 
# Project Objective: Customer Churn Prediction

The objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that predicts customer churn based on historical data.  By analyzing customer behavior, demographics, and engagement metrics, the model aims to identify patterns leading to churn.  

# Problem Statement:-
Customer churn is a critical issue for businesses, as losing customers impacts revenue and growth.

Traditional churn detection methods are often reactive, leading to delayed interventions.

This project aims to build a predictive model that identifies customers likely to churn based on features such as usage patterns, transaction history, customer service interactions, and subscription details.

By leveraging machine learning, businesses can take early action to retain at-risk customers, thereby reducing churn rates and improving customer lifetime value.
